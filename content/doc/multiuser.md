Pleaese note that this video is using speckle.streams components. It is shown here just as a demonstrator on how you can use speckle to split up your parametric definitions into more managable chunks using the power of the **interweb**.

The scenario:

- **TOP LEFT CORNER**: Morty the volumetric sketcher. He has a knack for seductive shapes. He's responsible for the building outline.
- **TOP RIGHT CORNER**: Theresa, the facade and panelisation expert. She's in charge of elaborating and detailing the roof geometry. 
- **BOTTOM LEFT CORNER**: Rick is the spaceplanner. He's in charge of defining the building's interiors.
- **BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER**: Bob is the master manager. He collects data from Morty, Theresa and Rick and prepares reports and quantification files.
