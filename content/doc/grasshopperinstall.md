# **Step 1:** Installation

Download the [latest rhino installer](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/SpeckleWorks/SpeckleRhino/artifacts/specklerhino.rhi?branch=master&job=Configuration%3DRelease).

Double click it and restart rhino.

# Step 2: Create Your First Account
Fire Rhino and Grasshopper up. The Speckle Components should appear in their own tab, called `Speckle`. Wow! Smooth sailing so far.

When you will first drag a Speckle Sender or Speckle Receiver component to the canvas, a dialog will ask you to create an account (or use an existing one).

Since I'm assuming you are a new user, let's go ahead and make a new one:

![spk](/img/ghinstall/newaccount.png)

- Server Url: use `https://hestia.speckle.works/api/v1` or, if you [deployed your own](/doc/deployaserver/), your ip/url address. 
- Email: your email address.
- Password: your password.
- Confirm: confirm your password.

Click register, and voila! You should be up and running: you can now send data between clients connected to the s003.speckle.works server. Get your friends to join in the fun ðŸ˜Ž
