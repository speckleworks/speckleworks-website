# Step 0: What's in the box
The releases contain both the Speckle Grasshopper Clients as well as the Speckle User Data Utils (more to come). 

# Step 1: Download the latest version.
Head over to [Speckle Grasshopper's release page](https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleGrasshopper/releases).

If you want to grab a specific version, feel free. Nevertheless, it usually best to download the latest version (ie highest release number). 

# Step 2: Installation
Close Rhino and Grasshopper if you have them running by any chance. 

Unzip the downloaded zip and copy and paste the two folders in the Grasshopper components folder: 
```
%appdata%\Roaming\Grasshopper\Libraries
```

Make sure that all _dll_ and _gha_ files are **not** in the root folder but in their own folder called _SpeckleSendReceive_. 

# Step 3: Create Your First Account
Fire Rhino and Grasshopper up. The Speckle Components should appear in their own tab, called `Speckle`. Wow! Smooth sailing so far.

When you will first drag a Speckle Sender or Speckle Receiver component to the canvas, a dialog will ask you to create an account (or use an existing one).

Since I'm assuming you are a new user, let's go ahead and make a new one: 

![spk](/img/ghinstall/newaccount.png)

- Server Url: use `https://s003.speckle.works/api` or, if you [deployed your own](/doc/deployaserver/), your ip/url address. 
- Email: your email address.
- Password: your password.
- Confirm: confirm your password.

Click register, and voila! You should be up and running: you can now send data between clients connected to the s003.speckle.works server. Get your friends to join in the fun ðŸ˜Ž
