In case you missed it, I'm going to be giving a Speckle workshop at the CoreTT AEC Symposium! I'll be there during the following hackaton too. 

Things that I will try and cover: 

- Bootstrapping a simple [Speckle Server](/doc/deployaserver)
- The [Speckle Grasshopper Components](/doc/senderreceiver) + [Custom Properties](/doc/userdatautils)
- The .NET Speckle Api ([SpeckleCore](/doc/specklehacks))
- Querying The Server
- Web Frontend Apps
