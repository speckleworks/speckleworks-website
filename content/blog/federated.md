Design data communication around complex projects is too big a issue to be handled in a centralized fashion. Furthermore, stakeholders have their own, project specific requirements when it comes to guaranteeing project data safety and all the issues around non-disclosure agreements - it's sometimes a schizophrenic world, but it's what we have to deal with.

Speckle is released under the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) - in case you're wondering, it's one of the most permissive licenses out there - for this specific reason: anyone is free to do take **Speckle** and deploy it as they see fit: 

- **internally**: _speckle.company.intranet_
- on a **per-project** basis: _project-x023.company.com_
- at a **company level**: _speckle.company.com_
- as a **SaaS**: _super-aec-data.com_

So if you're a small office with a spare computer, you're good to go. If you're ready to go next level, rent a Â£20/month virtual machine and unleash the fun of sharing design data around. 

Most importantly, we believe that it is good to dogfood your own principles: **Speckle** aims to enable a transparent and open design process, so why not apply that at a licensing level? Paraphrasing Linus Torvalds, 

> You can trust Speckle because you actually don't need to.

This leads to a different landscape where information is not centralised in files or service providers. Project information can be spread organically around stakeholders and **Speckle** deployments and selectively opened up based on needs arising from collaboration models, thus opening up new avenues for looking at the _social and information architecture_ of collaboration in complex - or simple - design projects.
