The ambition of Speckle is to enable a flexible and meaningful data rich design workflow between any stakeholders (technical or non-technical) involved in the design process and allow for users to structure their own communications channels and evolve their complexity gradually, from simple geometry to fully integrated BIM-like “smart” objects.

<!-- # People & Context -->
Speckle is growing out of research undertaken at [UCL The Bartlett School of Architecture](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/) as part of the Horizon 2020 [InnoChain](http://innochain.net) network.
