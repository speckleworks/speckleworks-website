The ambition of Speckle is to enable a flexible and meaningful data rich design workflow between any stakeholders (technical or non-technical) involved in the design process and allow for users to structure their own communications channels and evolve their complexity gradually, from simple geometry to fully integrated BIM-like “smart” objects.

## FAQ

#### Q: What's the difference with Flux.io/Konstru/etc? 

A: Flux.io is dead; Konstru's centralized and you have to pay. Speckle's as open source as they get, meaning no lock-in & no data centralisation and no standards monopoly: you own everything. This was a core design principle from the start that informed everything from how easy it is to deploy your own server to how you can extend speckle's schemas and create new types of clients.

#### Q: What will stop Speckle from dying off too, just like Flux?

A: Speckle is a community driven effort, built around the open source philosophy by which we believe in creating greater value globally at the expense of quik term gains. In short, you will.

#### Q: Why are you giving all this away for free? 

A: Because software is a zero-cost machine and, to begin with, Speckle was a research project in design communication, enabled by EU public funding. It's not just a technical research problem, it's also a political and social experiment to see whether an open source effort can exist in AEC.

#### Q: How can I contribute?

A: This is actually not a frequently asked question. But since you're here, you can join us [on slack](https://slacker.speckle.works) and check out the [git repos and their issues](https://github.com/speckleworks).

#### Q: Can Speckle do _____ or _______?
A: Usually yes. See above question how to get it done. We're planning to extend future functionality to expose API methods for project management, reporting, add collaboration features, versioning and history, etc.

#### Q: I've got another question...
A: Ask on our [forum](https://discourse.speckle.works) or join the [slack channel](https://slacker.speckle.works).
